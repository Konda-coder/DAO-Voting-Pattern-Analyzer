# DAO-Voting-Pattern-Analyzer
Analyze voting history across DAOs

##📌DOMAIN
**Data Science and Big Data Analytics**

##🧩 Problem Statement / Use Case
--
To analyze and visualize voting patterns across Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to uncover insights about proposal trends, voter participation, and governance dynamics.

### 💡 Proposed Solution

-Large, unstructured, and dispersed data sources

-Lack of user-friendly tools for visualizing voting trends

-Difficulty in identifying low participation or governance inefficiencies

-Limited transparency in proposal outcomes over time and region

##📝 Abstract / Problem Description
--
DAOs are reshaping digital governance by enabling decentralized, community-led decision-making. However, analyzing DAO voting data can be complex due to varying formats, on-chain data volumes, and lack of intuitive visualization tools.

DAO Voting Pattern Analyzer aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly platform that visualizes key metrics like voting turnout, proposal trends, and participation rates across different states and years. It helps DAO members, researchers, and developers gain a deeper understanding of governance behavior and participation dynamics over time. The tool uses an embedded Power BI dashboard for real-time insights and enables filtering by state and year for localized analysis.
